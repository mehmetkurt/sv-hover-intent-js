sv-hover-intent
=================================================

**sv-hover-intent** is a vanilla JavaScript plugin for handling mouse hovers on a delay. It tracks when the mouse movement has slowed enough that it's likely the user *intended* to activate that element.

It's useful for things like dropdown menus, to avoid them popping out if you happen to move past them (for example, when closing the browser tab).
